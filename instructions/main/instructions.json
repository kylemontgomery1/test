        "instructions": "1. Read the sentence from the Terms of Service. Make sure you understand the content and context of the sentence.\n2. Familiarize yourself with the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts. Understand that a contractual term is considered unfair if it has not been individually negotiated and if it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\n3. Analyze the sentence based on this understanding. Consider whether the term described in the sentence has been individually negotiated and whether it causes a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties.\n4. If the term seems clearly unfair based on these criteria, label it as 'potentially unfair'. If the term does not seem to be unfair, label it as 'not potentially unfair'.\n5. Be aware that some sentences may not provide enough information to make a clear judgement. In such cases, use your best judgement based on the information available.\n6. Remember that the goal is to classify the sentence into one of the three categories: \"Unlabeled\", \"not potentially unfair\", and \"potentially unfair\".

Hate speech is any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristic such as race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other characteristics. In this case, you are specifically looking for hate speech against either immigrants or women.\n3. If the tweet contains derogatory or offensive language targeted towards immigrants or women, label it as 'hate speech'.\n4. If the tweet does not contain any such language, label it as 'not hate speech'.\n5. Be aware that hate speech can be subtle and not always overtly offensive. It can be disguised as a joke or a casual comment. Look for such nuances in the tweet.\n6. Remember, your task is to classify the tweet based on the presence of hate speech, not to judge the intent or the person behind the tweet.\n7.

The fields include 'Tweet text', 'ID', and 'Label'. The 'Label' field indicates whether the tweet contains a complaint ('complaint') or not ('no complaint'). \n\n2. Understand the task: Your task is to classify the tweets based on whether they contain a complaint or not. \n\n3. Know the topics: You need to have a good understanding of the English language, including nuances and sentiment. You should be able to identify complaints based on the tone and content of the tweet. \n\n4. Steps to answer the questions: \n   - Read the 'Tweet text' carefully.\n   - Identify the sentiment of the tweet. If it expresses dissatisfaction or a problem, it is likely a complaint.\n   - Label the tweet as 'complaint' if it contains a complaint, and 'no complaint' if it does not. \n\n5. Tips: \n   - Pay attention to words that indicate dissatisfaction or a problem, as they may indicate a complaint.\n   - Consider the overall tone of the tweet. Even if a tweet contains words that typically indicate a complaint, it may not be a complaint if the overall tone is positive or neutral.\n   - Remember that sarcasm can be common on social media, so a tweet that seems positive on the surface may actually be a complaint.",

Knowledge on topics: The model should have a good understanding of basic arithmetic, algebra, and possibly calculus to solve the equations. This includes knowledge on operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, solving for x, and understanding of functions and their properties.\n\n3. Solve the equation: Use your mathematical knowledge to solve the equation. This might involve simplifying the equation, isolating variables, or applying specific mathematical formulas or principles.\n\n4. Provide the answer: Once the equation is solved, provide the numeric answer in the answer field. Ensure the answer is accurate and precise.\n\n5.

Try to be as concise as possible while still conveying the main points of the article. Avoid including unnecessary details.\n\n4. Maintain the original meaning: While the summary should be concise, it should also accurately represent the content of the article. Do not change the meaning of the original text in your summary.\n\n5. Use your own words: While it's important to maintain the original meaning, try to paraphrase the content in your own words. This is an important aspect of text summarization.\n\n6. Check your work: After writing the summary, read it over to ensure it accurately represents the main points of the article. Make sure there are no grammatical or spelling errors.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a summary that provides a clear and concise overview of the article's content. Good luck!",

Analyze the question: Each question in the dataset is a short natural language narrative that describes a state of the world and poses a question about some unknown quantities. Make sure to carefully read and understand the problem before attempting to solve it.\n\n3. Solve the problem: Use your mathematical knowledge to solve the problem. This may involve basic arithmetic, fractions, percentages, or simple algebra. \n\n4. Check your answer: Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. Answer in complete sentences: Since the dataset is in English and the modality is text, make sure to answer in complete, grammatically correct sentences.\n\n6. Be sensitive to the question: The dataset tests if the model is question sensitive. This means that the model should be able to understand and respond to the specific question being asked, rather than giving a generic or unrelated answer.\n\n7. Show robust reasoning ability: The dataset also tests the model's reasoning ability. This means that the model should be able to logically work through the problem and come up with a correct and reasonable answer.\n\n8. Be invariant to structural alterations: The dataset tests if the model is invariant to structural alterations. This means that the model should be able to solve the problem even if the structure of the problem is altered slightly.\n\nRemember, the goal is not just to get the correct answer, but to demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and a logical approach to solving it.",
